                    <p><strong>HIKING HAS BEEN ONE OF MY NEWEST PASSION IN LIFE SINCE COMING TO JAPAN. AROUND THE TIME WHEN I STARTED THIS HOBBY, THE ALLURE 
                        WAS (AND STILL IS!) THAT IT WAS A FORM OF EXERCISE THAT I CAN DO WHILE ALSO GIVING MYSELF THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE MORE OF JAPAN'S BEAUTIFUL NATURE.
                        NEEDLESS TO SAY, HIKING IN JAPAN HAS YET TO FAIL ME ON BOTH FRONT. I AM NOW FITTER THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN WHILE ALSO GETTING TO SEE THE MORE RURAL/WILD SIDE OF JAPAN. :) </strong>

                    <p> <strong>PROGRAMMING WAS AN INTEREST THAT GREW OVER TIME FOR ME. AT THE BEGINNING I STUDY PROGRAMMING SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
                        SECURING MY FUTURE CAREER PATH. HOWEVER, WITH EVERY PROJECT CAME A BOOST OF EXCITEMENT THAT ULTIMATELY MADE ME REALIZE THAT PROGRAMMING WAS FOR ME ALL ALONG. 
                        BY NO MEANS AM I AN EXPERT ON PROGRAMMING. BUT I'M LEARNING MORE AND MORE BY THE DAY.  
                        IN FACT, I BUILT THIS VERY WEBPAGE USING HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT AND HAD IT HOSTED ON MY  <a class="social-list__link" href="https://github.com/Minh-ctrl">GITHUB PAGES</a>.
